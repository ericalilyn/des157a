        <h1>User Test Results</h1>

        <h2>Significant Observations</h2>
        <p>The first significant observation is that the image does not adjust to different viewport sizes. In the viewport of the full window on the iMac, the image was not wide enough to fill the entire window, which left a margin of space on the right side that revealed the default white viewport background. This caused the info button at the top right of the window to "disappear," since it was a white colored element which blended in with the white viewport.</p>
        <p>The second significant observation is that the hotspots are not easy to find because there is no immediate visual indicator as to where they are located. The hotspots only appear as semitransparent boxes when the user mouses over the area. Both the lack of these visual indicators and no clear instruction on needing to mouseover to make hotspots apparent resulted in the user being very confused about how to interact with highlighted areas.</p>
        <p>The third significant observation is that the user may try to interact with the intro screen, which is a timed animation and and not meant to be interactive. During the user test, this was caused by how long the intro was visible for until it faded out, so the user did not perceive it as a timed animation initially.</p>

        <h2>Updates Based on Feedback</h2>
        <p>I will update my Final Project to improve the faults found in the observations from the user test. For the image to viewport size problem, I will need to make the image fill the viewport for different screen sizes. For the hotspot visibility problem, I will add better indication as to where they are and how to interact with them. For any intro screen confusion, I will make the animation shorter so it fades out quicker.</p>
