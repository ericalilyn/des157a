        <h1>Final Project Design Brief</h1>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>My final project will be updating my Every Picture project on my visits to Ocean Beach in San Francisco to make it more immersive, interactive, and user friendly.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals for this project are to make my Every Picture more immersive and descriptive, and to enhance the poetry of the visuals. I plan to make it more interactive than just scrolling though, perhaps have a "traveling to â€¦" element to it before entering the main page. I think a stretch goal I want to have is adding audio, something like atmospheric sounds of the beach but this might be hard to do since it is in San Francisco. If I did this, I might need to go home for the weekend to record the sounds on location.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>I avoided type in the original design because I thought it would not look that good, but it ended up being more confusing, so I think including it for the final will help with the UX/UI. The overall look and feel is going to be similar, with the addition of type that might appear delayed and fading in so it is subtle, since I still want it to be mainly visual based. Type color might be white or another light color to be visible against the image. I think for the typeface, a serif font would be more poetic but might not be the most readable, so I might have to experiment with how it displays.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>My plans for interactions include adding atmospheric audio that plays in the background, or if possible, have specific audio for each section. Based on feedback about not knowing what to do when the page loads on the image, I will also add an instruction that appears on load to let users know to scroll. I think adding more inputs like click or hover would add to the interactivity of the page, since it is just a scroll on zoom project as of right now. Since I will probably make the image bigger so it is more detailed, I will also need to add a loading screen which would be based on time.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>I think making the loading screen fit the idea of the user going to Ocean Beach (entering the page) would help add to the immersive experience of it all. So when the user maneuvers down the screen, it is like they are traveling to each area of the beach with the photos. I will add descriptions of what it might be like there based on my own experiences, but I want the final to have the perspective of the user. The audio aspect would help with this because it would add a sensory experience to it that would complement the visuals and type.</p>
